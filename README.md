# saved-contacts-extractor-and-finder-doyin
Python class to extracts contact names and phone-numbers from saved phonebook contact .vcf file and allows you to search for specific contacts using name or phone number.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by my need to find some numbers when my mobile phone got spoilt. Although i had the contacts exported to an external memory card, i still could not access nor find certain contacts without getting hold of another mobile phone to import the stored contacts to (which at the moment was not even available). 

I obviously would not want to borrow a friend's mobile phone and bombard his/her contacts with my own contacts, especially when all the efforts would only be just finding a few contacts.

So, I wrote this program, hoping that it would be useful to someone else somewhere, facing the same or similar ordeal.

## Note
Please *'star'* this project if you find it useful to you. That way i feel encouraged to do more. Thanks.
